Coding Challenge One - Fix The DNS wrapper library
====

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/magnises/code-challenge-one.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/magnises/code-challenge-one)

### Challenge Requirements:

_Est time: ~30-60min_

We created this DNS wrapper module and started moving it to Node _v6.2.x_ from _v0.12.x_. Unfortunately tests aren't passing as expected. You should __fork this repo__ and fix the problems with the tests failing. 90% or more of your fixes should be applied to the lib/dns.service.js. The test file provided should pass without issue.

After your done, submit a __rebased__ pull request. A successful PR will pass on our circle CI.

### Installation:

```
npm install
```

### Test Suite:

```
ava
```
